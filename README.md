# flask_docker_app
An e-commerce company's backend application built using flask
An ER diagram is included to show the relationship between the different Entities/Models
A raw SQL file is also included to help understand the project better before diving into the main flask folder
Using the information above will aid in both visual and basic SQL comprehension.

This project is still ongoing and the final readme file will be available once completed.
